## Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for choosing to contribute in Dashify. There are a ton of great open-source projects out there, so we appreciate your interest in contributing to Dashify.

## Open Issues

If you would like to help in working on open issues. Lookout for following tags: `good first issue`, `help wanted`, and `open for contribution`.

## Development setup

We use Go@1.20 as minimal version.

Install the dependencies:

```shell
go get
```

## Code Formatting

We use [Gofmt](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/gofmt) (latest version)
for code formatting. Using vscode will make this thing easier.
